This C# code showcases a simple program that manipulates a two-dimensional array and an ArrayList. It initializes a 2D array with regional and sales representative names, then iterates through this array to display its contents. An ArrayList is used to selectively store and manipulate certain names from the array. The program demonstrates adding to, checking, and removing elements from the ArrayList, along with displaying its size and contents at various stages. This example illustrates basic data structure manipulation, useful in managing and processing structured data.
